          I‚Äôm Arif Rajer, a passionate and dedicated real estate professional
          proudly serving clients across Ontario. My primary focus is on the

          My journey began in the field of Pharmacy. I earned my degree from
          Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan, Pakistan, followed by an
          M.Phil in Pharmaceutical Chemistry. I initially built my career
          working in research and pharmaceutical promotions, collaborating with
          esteemed multinational companies and medical professionals.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted mb-5 leading-relaxed">
          In 1994, I embraced new horizons in the UAE, serving as a registered
          pharmacist with prestigious pharmacy groups like Al-Yousuf Medicine
          and Ibn Sina Pharmacies. These years strengthened my professional
          discipline, commitment to client satisfaction, and keen attention to
          detail.

        <p className="text-muted mb-5 leading-relaxed">
          Immigrating to Canada in 2011 with my family presented fresh

          perspective allow me to expertly assist clients in buying, selling,
          investing, Pre-Construction, relocation, and commercial real estate.
