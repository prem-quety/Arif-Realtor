          {/* Professional Journey */}
          <p className="text-muted mb-5 leading-relaxed">
            My journey began in the field of Pharmacy. I earned my degree from
            Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan, Pakistan, followed by an
            M.Phil in Pharmaceutical Chemistry. I initially built my career
            working in research and pharmaceutical promotions, collaborating
            with esteemed multinational companies and medical professionals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted mb-5 leading-relaxed">
            In 1994, I embraced new horizons in the UAE, serving as a registered
            pharmacist with prestigious pharmacy groups like Al-Yousuf Medicine
            and Ibn Sina Pharmacies. These years strengthened my professional
            discipline, commitment to client satisfaction, and keen attention to
            detail.

          <p className="text-muted mb-5 leading-relaxed">
            Immigrating to Canada in 2011 with my family presented fresh
            opportunities. After exploring various paths, I found my true
            calling in real estate in March 2020. My diverse background and
            global perspective allow me to expertly assist clients in buying,
            selling, investing, Pre-Construction, relocation, and commercial
            real estate.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Over the past five years, I've facilitated over fifty real estate
            transactions, earning prestigious industry awards for three
            consecutive years. My commitment to integrity, diligence, and
            exceptional client care has formed lasting relationships, built
            primarily on satisfied clients‚Äô referrals and trust.
